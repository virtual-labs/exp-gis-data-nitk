            "a": "To store geographical data",
            "b": "To visually communicate spatial information",

            "d": "To perform spatial analysis on geographic features"
          },
          "explanations": {
            "a": "Storing geographical data is a GIS function, but the primary role of cartography is representation, not storage.",
            "b": "Correct Answer. The core purpose of cartography is to visually represent and communicate spatial information through maps.",
            "c": "Data collection from satellite imagery is part of remote sensing, not cartography.",
            "d": "Spatial analysis is performed using GIS tools, but cartography focuses on effective spatial data visualization."

          },
          "explanations": {
            "a": "A title helps identify the map's subject but is not the only essential element.",
            "b": "A legend explains the symbols used in the map, aiding interpretation, but by itself, itâ€™s not enough.",
            "c": "A scale bar allows users to measure distances on the map accurately.",
            "d": "Correct Answer. All of these elements (title, legend, and scale bar) are essential for effectively communicating the map's information."

          "question": "In cartography, what is the purpose of a map projection?",
          "answers": {
            "a": "To measure distances on a map",
            "b": "To convert 3D geographic coordinates to a 2D map",

            "d": "To represent elevation and terrain features"
          },
          "explanations": {
            "a": "Measuring distances is a use of the map but not the purpose of projection.",
            "b": "Correct Answer. Map projections are designed to convert the Earth's 3D surface into a 2D plane, making it easier to display on flat surfaces.",
            "c": "Enhancing resolution refers to image processing, not map projection.",
            "d": "Representing elevation and terrain features is handled by contouring or shading, not projection."

            "a": "A large-scale map covers a larger geographic area",
            "b": "A large-scale map shows more detail and covers a smaller area",

            "d": "A small-scale map shows high-resolution raster data"
          },
          "explanations": {
            "a": "Large-scale maps cover smaller areas with more detail, not larger areas.",
            "b": "Correct Answer. A large-scale map has a smaller ratio, showing more detail and covering a smaller area.",
            "c": "Small-scale maps are not specifically for 3D representations.",
            "d": "Small-scale maps do not always show high-resolution data; they represent larger areas with less detail."
